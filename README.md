# CSI4506-Project
Introduction to AI course project

## Quick description

This repo contains a [notebook](Prediction_of_NBA_fantasy_scores.ipynb) where we go from a raw dataset and build, evaluate and discuss regression models to predict fantasy basketball scores (DraftKings to be precise).  

## Important files

Not all files are essential to the notebook, so we'll list them here (others are drafts or were used to collect data):
- Prediction_of_NBA_fantasy_scores.ipynb
  - The notebook
- NBA Stats Database - Player Game Stats 2017 (1) 
  - The dataset
- Serialized models. Not essential, but they'll save you a lot of time. Delete them if you want to retrain them.
