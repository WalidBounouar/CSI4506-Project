    "- **Derived**: Other feature(s) offers similar information or can litteraly be used to derive the feature.\n",

    "| 'Position' | **Optional** | This is a bit 'inside baseball', but the modern move towards positionless basketball makes us think adding this feature wouldn't be usefull enough. |\n",
    "| '(NBAS Team)' | **Optional** | We don't believe knowing the team adds something if we know the team stats. Also, playing agains Miami in 2012 isn't the same as Miami in 2019, so there is a time constraint on this feature. |\n",
    "| '(BBref Team)' | **Useless** | This is also the team, see '(NBAS Team)' |\n",

    "| '(BBref Opponent)' | **Useless** | This is also the opponent, see 'DK Opponent' |\n",
    "| 'Home' | **Main** | Knowing if the game is at home seems very interesting as home court advantage is big in basketball. |\n",
    "| 'Match Up' | **Useless** | This is just a combination of team and opponent, so same reasonning. |\n",
    "| 'Date' | **Optional** | Wethink the date should not have to much impact, especially the exact date. Maybe the month can catch some trends. However, we will use this feature to do some changes later on. |\n",
    "| 'Min' | **Not predictive** | This is the number of minute played for a game. We don't know this beforehand, so no predictive value. |\n",
    "| '(Double digit stats)' | **Main** | Unfortunatly, we're not sure what this is, so we'll ignore it for now. It seems like it says how many of the player's stats were in double digit, which once again is not know beforhand so no predictive value. |\n",
