    "- **Derived**: Other feature(s) offers similar information or can litteraly be used to derive the feature.\n",

    "| 'Position' | **Optional** | This is a bit 'inside baseball', but the modern move towards positionless basketball makes us think adding this feature wouldn't be usefull enough. |\n",
    "| '(NBAS Team)' | **Optional** | We don't believe knowing the team adds something if we know the team stats. Also, playing agains Miami in 2012 isn't the same as Miami in 2019, so there is a time constraint on this feature. |\n",
    "| '(BBref Team)' | **Useless** | This is also the team, see '(NBAS Team)' |\n",

    "| '(NBAS Opponent)' | **Useless** |  This is also the opponent, see 'DK Opponent' |\n",
    "| '(BBref Opponent)' | **Useless** | This is also the opponent, see 'DK Opponent' |\n",
    "| 'Home' | **Main** | Knowing if the game is at home seems very interesting as home court advantage is big in basketball. |\n",
    "| 'Match Up' | **Useless** | This is just a combination of team and opponent, so same reasonning. |\n",
    "| 'Date' | **Optional** | Wethink the date should not have to much impact, especially the exact date. Maybe the month can catch some trends. However, we will use this feature to do some changes later on. |\n",
    "| 'Min' | **Not predictive** | This is the number of minute played for a game. We don't know this beforehand, so no predictive value. |\n",
    "| '(Double digit stats)' | **Main** | Unfortunatly, we're not sure what this is, so we'll ignore it for now. It seems like it says how many of the player's stats were in double digit, which once again is not know beforhand so no predictive value. |\n",
    "| '(Unadj Pts)' | **Useless** | We made the design decision that our label column would be 'DK Points scored'. This column offers roughly the same information. |\n",
    "| 'DK Points Scored' | **Main** | This is our label column. Essential. |\n",
    "| 'Team Points' | **Not predictive** | This is the points the team scored. We don't know this beforehand, no predictive value. |\n",
    "| 'Player Avg Pts/min' | **Main** | This seems interesting since points are a big part of fantasy production. |\n",
    "| 'Team Avg Pace' | **Main** | Interesting since the higher the pace, the more chances there are to score for the player. |\n",
    "| 'Opponent Avg Pace' | **Main** | Same reasoning as 'Team Avg Pace'. |\n",

    "As explained above, a 'min_samples_leaf' too low will lead to overfitting. We want to try some values around the 20 that is recommanded. A float value means that the value of 'min_samples_leaf' will be a fraction of the total dataset: ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples).  \n",

    "\n",
    "'min_samples_split' is the minimum number of element in a node required to split it. It is closely linked to 'min_samples_leaf' and both will have a similar effect of smoothing out the tree to prevent overfitting when the correct value is used. The float value work the same as with 'min_samples_leaf'.\n",

    "'splitter' will decide how an attribute from the dataset is selected to do the split on a node in the tree. If 'best' is used, the attribute is chosen will always be the best according to the algorithm (see section 'Construction de l’arbre' of the report). If 'random' is used, a random attribute from the dataset is selected for each split. Usually, using random is less computationally intensive and can be less prone to overfitting.  \n",

    "'criterion' is the function to mesure the quality of a split.  'mse' is the mean squared error, 'friedman_mse' is the mean squared error with Friedman’s improvement score and 'mae' is the mean absolute error.  \n",
