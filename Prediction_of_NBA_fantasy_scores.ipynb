    "\n",
    "| Feature | Category | Justification |\n",
    "|:--------|:---------|:--------------|\n",
    "| 'Name' | **Optional** | we think a players stats should define him well enough. Also, on-hot encoding of this column would add 500+ features. |  \n",
    "| 'Position' | **Optional** | This is a bit 'inside baseball', but the modern move towards positionless basketball makes us think adding this feature wouldn't be usefull enough. |\n",
    "| '(NBAS Team)' | **Optional** | We don't believe knowing the team adds something if we know the team stats. Also, playing agains Miami in 2012 isn't the same as Miami in 2019, so there is a time constraint on this feature. |\n",
    "| '(BBref Team)' | **Useless** | This is also the team, see '(NBAS Team)' |\n",
    "| 'DK Team' | **Useless** | This is also the team, see '(NBAS Team)' |\n",
    "| '(Team)' | **Useless** | This is also the team, see '(NBAS Team)' |\n",
    "| '(vs.)' | **Useless** | This is useless. |\n",
    "| 'DK Opponent' | **Optional** | We believe knowing the opponent has limited value if we know the opponent stats. |\n",
    "| '(NBAS Opponent)' | **Useless** |  This is also the opponent, see 'DK Opponent' |\n",
    "| '(BBref Opponent)' | **Useless** | This is also the opponent, see 'DK Opponent' |\n",
    "| 'Home' | **Main** | Knowing if the game is at home seems very interesting as home court advantage is big in basketball. |\n",
    "| 'Match Up' | **Useless** | This is just a combination of team and opponent, so same reasonning. |\n",
    "| 'Date' | **Optional** | Wethink the date should not have to much impact, especially the exact date. Maybe the month can catch some trends. However, we will use this feature to do some changes later on. |\n",
    "| 'Min' | **Not predictive** | This is the number of minute played for a game. We don't know this beforehand, so no predictive value. |\n",
    "| '(Double digit stats)' | **Main** | Unfortunatly, we're not sure what this is, so we'll ignore it for now. It seems like it says how many of the player's stats were in double digit, which once again is not know beforhand so no predictive value. |\n",
    "| '(Unadj Pts)' | **Useless** | We made the design decision that our value to predict column would be 'DK Points scored'. This column offers roughly the same information. |\n",
    "| 'DK Points Scored' | **Main** | This is our value to predict column. Essential. |\n",
    "| 'Team Points' | **Not predictive** | This is the points the team scored. We don't know this beforehand, no predictive value. |\n",
    "| 'Player Avg Pts/min' | **Main** | This seems interesting since points are a big part of fantasy production. |\n",
    "| 'Team Avg Pace' | **Main** | Interesting since the higher the pace, the more chances there are to score for the player. |\n",
    "| 'Opponent Avg Pace' | **Main** | Same reasoning as 'Team Avg Pace'. |\n",
    "| 'Team FG' | **Main** | Team average field goal made per game. We find it interesting, though it's similar to the pace. |\n",
    "| 'Team FGA' | **Main** | Team average field goal attemps per game. We find it interesting, though it's similar to the pace. |\n",
    "| 'Team FG%' | **Derived** | While useful, it's fairly similiar to having both 'Team FG' and 'Team FGA'. |\n",
    "| 'Team 3P' | **Main** | Same reasoning as 'Team FG' |\n",
    "| 'Team 3PA' | **Main** | Same reasoning as 'Team FGA' | \n",

Most source said that it would be overkill to have a great number of layers with hundreds of nodes. So we played around with 1-3 layers and 50-100 nodes. We also experimented with different values of hyperparameters based on what we learned in class. All this experimentaition isn't documented because results were always fairly similar and the notebook would be bloated.  \n",

This means all possible combinations of parameter values will be evaluated and it will keep the best one. We will be using the default scoring function (sklearn.metrics.r2_score) to evaluate which combination is the best."

    "From our research, we found that the max_depth, min_samples_split and min_samples_leaf are the parameters that have the most influence on the accuracy of the model.  \n",

    "As explained above, a 'min_samples_leaf' too low will lead to overfitting. We want to try some values around the 20 that is recommanded. A float value means that the value of 'min_samples_leaf' will be a fraction of the total dataset: ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples).  \n",
    "\n",
    "'max_depth' is used to limit the depth of the tree. Like we mentionned in the One-hot encoding section of the report, the one-hot encoding in the dataset can lead to a deep tree. We want to try to limit that depth and see if it can help to make the tree more accurate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "'min_samples_split' is the minimum number of element in a node required to split it. It is closely linked to 'min_samples_leaf' and both will have a similar effect of smoothing out the tree to prevent overfitting when the correct value is used. The float value work the same as with 'min_samples_leaf'.\n",
    "\n",
    "'splitter' will decide how an attribute from the dataset is selected to do the split on a node in the tree. If 'best' is used, the attribute is chosen will always be the best according to the algorithm (see section 'Construction de l’arbre' of the report). If 'random' is used, a random attribute from the dataset is selected for each split. Usually, using random is less computationally intensive and can be less prone to overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "'criterion' is the function to mesure the quality of a split.  'mse' is the mean squared error, 'friedman_mse' is the mean squared error with Friedman’s improvement score and 'mae' is the mean absolute error.  \n",

    "First, we see that the Custom dataset performs better than the other dataset when it comes to the basic method. This seems like an early indication that the Custom feature set offers better performance, or at least that monthly data has some value. However, this is flipped when it comes to the machine learning models. We think a possible reason might be that machine learning methods use all the features of the dataset, while basic method only uses the player's statistics. It could be that the features only used in the ML models (mostly team statistics) are not good predictors when using monthly averages compared to using season averages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we see that our machine learning models perform better than our basic approach when it comes to the Full, Lightweight  and Big datasets. This a a great sign that we are not wasting our time with machine learning models and that they do offer some value over just using a player's average stats to predict his performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we can observe that the performances between the Full and Lightweight datasets are very similar. This is a great sign that our feature engineering worked. The attributes we judged optional or derived do indeed seem to add little value to our models. However, we also wanted to have the Lightweight dataset because we thought it was more generalisable, but we did not verify it. More on this in the conclusion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, one of our goals was to compare both models, MLP regressor and Regression Tree. We see that after optimization, both models seem to offer roughly the same results. Furthermore, even time to fit was very similar from our qualitative observations. We'd be interested to test other models, but this similarity leads us to the observation we find the most interesting.  \n",

    "Finally, if we consider that\n",

    "- performance of the Full and Lightweight dataset were very similar\n",
    "- the Big dataset (combining season and month statistics) is slightly better than other datasets  \n",

    "We think that the obvious conclusion is that, at the core of all this, it's the data that matters. Different models may lead to slight improvements, but the bigggest contributor to the quality of the predictions is the amount and the quality of the data we are basing the models on."

While this is an accurate representation of an NBA season, it's not an appropriate representation of a fantasy team. It's very rare that the 14th man on a NBA roster is used in a fantasy team. SO including such players muddies the dataset for nothing. We did actually play around with cutting all rows of the dataset with very low fantasy scores, but this is too heavy handed. A good way would have been to remove all the players that had low season averages for playing time.  \n",

Some of our feature engineering was done to have models that would generlize across seasons. For example, the Full dataset uses the team names as parameters (one-hot). However, playing against Miami in 2017-2018 is not the same as playing against Miami in 2019-2020. For this reason, we hoped out Lightweight dataset would generalize better. We unfortunatly did not have the time to fetch relevant test data to accomplish our goal.\n",

    "Third, all of our feature engineering was based on our domain expertise (well, as much as a fan can be considered an expert). It would have been interesting to do a correlation analysis between the features and the fantasy score (value to predict). This might have helped us really identify the relevant features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we wanted to compare our models to other prediction websites. This had no real analytical value, but it would have been a fun comparison."
